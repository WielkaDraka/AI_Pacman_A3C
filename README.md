## Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C)

Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) is a reinforcement learning algorithm that uses multiple agents to interact with the environment in parallel, improving training efficiency and stability.

### Key Features:
- **Asynchronous Learning:** Multiple agents explore the environment simultaneously, reducing correlation.
- **Actor-Critic Method:** The actor learns the policy, while the critic estimates the value function.

### Applications:
- Complex game environments (e.g., Doom, StarCraft)
- Robotics
- Real-time strategy games
